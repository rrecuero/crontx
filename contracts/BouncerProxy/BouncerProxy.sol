/*
  Bouncer identity proxy that executes meta transactions for etherless accounts.

  Purpose:
  I wanted a way for etherless accounts to transact with the blockchain through an identity proxy without paying gas.
  I'm sure there are many examples of something like this already deployed that work a lot better, this is just me learning.
    (I would love feedback: https://twitter.com/austingriffith)

  1) An etherless account crafts a meta transaction and signs it
  2) A (properly incentivized) relay account submits the transaction to the BouncerProxy and pays the gas
  3) If the meta transaction is valid AND the etherless account is a valid 'Bouncer', the transaction is executed
      (and the sender is paid in arbitrary tokens from the signer)

//new use case: something very similar to the eth alarm clock dudes
// gitcoin wants to run a subscription like service and have all the trasacions
// run as meta trasactions so accounts don't have to worry about getting on at
// a certain time to push a tx through every month, week, day, hour, etc
// we'll use a minBlock requirement and have a nonce for each minBlock so
// other transactions can still come through normally with minBlock=0 but
// you also want to avoid replay attacks for specific minBlocks


//use case 1:
//you deploy the bouncer proxy and use it as a standard identity for your own etherless accounts
//  (multiple devices you don't want to store eth on or move private keys to will need to be added as Bouncers)
//you run your own relayer and the rewardToken is 0

//use case 2:
//you deploy the bouncer proxy and use it as a standard identity for your own etherless accounts
//  (multiple devices you don't want to store eth on or move private keys to will need to be added as Bouncers)
//  a community if relayers are incentivized by the rewardToken to pay the gas to run your transactions for you
//SEE: universal logins via @avsa

//use case 3:
//you deploy the bouncer proxy and use it to let third parties submit transactions as a standard identity
//  (multiple developer accounts will need to be added as Bouncers to 'whitelist' them to make meta transactions)
//you run your own relayer and pay for all of their transactions, revoking any bad actors if needed
//SEE: GitCoin (via @owocki) wants to pay for some of the initial transactions of their Developers to lower the barrier to entry

//use case 4:
//you deploy the bouncer proxy and use it to let third parties submit transactions as a standard identity
//  (multiple developer accounts will need to be added as Bouncers to 'whitelist' them to make meta transactions)
//you run your own relayer and pay for all of their transactions, revoking any bad actors if needed
